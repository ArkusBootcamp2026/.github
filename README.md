# ArkusBootcamp2026

Welcome to **ArkusBootcamp2026**. This GitHub organization is a training sandbox for bootcamp participants to practice real team workflows before touching production code.

## What this org is for
- ✅ Hands-on exercises with real GitHub flow
- ✅ Creating Pull Requests (PRs)
- ✅ Reviewing and approving PRs
- ✅ Working across each other’s repositories
- ✅ Getting comfortable with collaboration, code ownership, and feedback

## How it works
1. Bootcamp participants each get one or more repositories.
2. Exercises require interacting with other participants’ repos (not just your own).
3. Work is submitted through PRs, reviewed by peers (and/or mentors), then merged.
4. Repos here are intentionally “practice-first” so mistakes are safe and encouraged.

## Contribution Workflow

### Branch naming
- `feat/<short-description>`
- `fix/<short-description>`
- `chore/<short-description>`
- `docs/<short-description>`

### PR rules (edit as needed)
- PR title format: `type: summary` (example: `feat: add login form validation`)
- Include a clear description of what changed and why
- Link issues when relevant
- Request reviews from:
  - <!-- e.g. 1 peer + 1 mentor -->
- Only merge when:
  - ✅ Checks pass
  - ✅ Required approvals received
  - ✅ Conflicts resolved

### Review guidelines
- Be kind, specific, and actionable
- Prefer “why” over “just do this”
- Ask questions when something is unclear
- Suggest improvements, don’t rewrite someone’s entire life story
