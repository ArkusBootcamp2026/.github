ArkusBootcamp2026 is a sandbox org for 2026 bootcamp exercises. It hosts trainee repos used to practice real-world collaboration: working across each other’s codebases, opening pull requests, reviewing changes, and approving PRs. The goal is to build solid Git workflows and team habits before jumping into production projects.
